# Bitfinex

For those who have the ability to ignore cyptocurrency news, the United States Department of Justice published a press release from February 8th 2022: *Two Arrested for Alleged Conspiracy to Launder $4.5 Billion in Stolen Cryptocurrency*[^DOJ-press-release].

> According to court documents, Lichtenstein and Morgan allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin that were stolen from Bitfinexâ€™s platform after a hacker breached Bitfinexâ€™s systems and initiated more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions.

Notice the language used here: "stolen from Bitfinex's platform" not "stolen from Bitfinex". The coins belonged to the users of the platform and not the platform itself. Unfortunately for them, the old "not your keys, not your coins" adage rung true.

The hack was reported by Bitfinex on August 2nd 2016.

> Today we discovered a security breach that requires us to halt all trading on Bitfinex, as well as halt all digital token deposits to and withdrawals from Bitfinex[^security-breach].

If this was heart-wrenching for Bitfinex users to read, the update published four days later would give them a full-on heart attack.

> After much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context. Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%[^security-breach-update].

Unable or unwilling to eat the losses themselves, Bitfinex passed it on by taking 36% of customer funds: BTC, ETH, USD, etc.

> In place of the loss in each wallet, we are crediting a token labeled BFX to record each customerâ€™s discrete losses. Tokens will be distributed without release or waiver. The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until redeemed in full by Bitfinex or possibly exchangedâ€”upon the creditorâ€™s request and Bitfinexâ€™s acceptanceâ€”for shares of iFinex Inc[^security-breach].

Enter, BFX token. The first of three tokens created by Bitfinex to wash their hands of the hack. Think of these tokens as IOUs. They were unregulated, came with no defined payback schedule, offered zero interest, and were provided to users in a forced sale.

The number of BFX a user received was based on their "discrete losses" as opposed to "continuous losses". Suppose a user `ShrekIsLove` had 3BTC on Bitfinex pre-hack. The hack occurs and Bitfinex takes 36% of their BTC, about 1BTC, in exchange for around 600BFX tokens. $600 was roughly the USD price of Bitcoin at the time of the hack. Of course the numbers used were significantly more precise but round numbers are easier to think about. Bitfinex significantly reduced their debt by "snapshotting" the price because Bitcoin rallied until December 2017 when it reached an all time high of $20,000. It seems `1BTC == 1BTC` until shit hits the fan. 

Obviously, this methodology upset a lot of users but some saw it as the best chance for recouping their losses and were understanding[^understanding]. So what are `ShrekIsLove`s options going forward?

1. Hold their BFX tokens in the hopes that Bitfinex would redeem them for the full amount,
2. sell them for cents on the dollar to other traders,
3. or convert them to iFinex shares, Bitfinex's parent company. 

**I'll be referring to iFinex in place of Bitfinex for the rest of the article**.

iFinex was redeeming BFX tokens albeit slowly [^redemption-slow]. As a result, confidence that redemption of all the coins was low and their open market price of around $0.30 reflected that[^30-cents]. Sellers wanted to recoup a portion of their losses and be done with the ordeal waiving all legal claims against iFinex on account of the losses[^bfx-token-terms]. Buyers and holders were betting that iFinex would repurchase their tokens for the full dollar amount. iFinex partnered with a company called BnkToTheFuture to create a Special Purpose Vehicle [SPV], which surprisingly is not a Delorean that time travels to before the hack, but a way for users to convert BFX tokens into equity[^spv]. iFinex wanted their users to convert as this would reduce the number of BFX tokens they were obligated to redeem regardless of the recovery of stolen funds. To push users in this direction they introduced the second of three tokens called the Recovery Right Token [RRT]. 

RRTs were nearly identical to BFXs in that they were both redeemable for $1 and tradeable on the exchange, the difference being that iFinex was only obligated to redeem RRTs when and if the stolen coins were recovered. A user who chose to convert would lose the chance of being redeemed prior to recovery but maintain the right to redemption if a recovery occured and gain a stake in a highly profitable business assuming iFinex could make it through these choppy waters. If a user wanted to go this route, they would need to act fast:

> If subscribed on or before October 7, 2016, each investor will get 1 RRT for each BFX token exchanged for shares;
> If subscribed after October 7, 2016, and on or before October 31, 2016, each investor will get Â½ an RRT for each BFX token exchanged for shares;
> If subscribed after October 31, 2016, and on or before November 30, 2016, each investor will get Â¼ an RRT for each BFX token exchanged for shares; and,
> If subscribed after November 30, 2016, no RRTs will be delivered[^rtt].

This FOMO based scheme incentivised users to convert to shares quickly. The longer users held their BFX in the hopes of redemption, the fewer RRTs they'd receive if they ended up converting.

`ShrekIsLove` is a US citizen but he did not share that information with Bitfinex. He didn't have to as he only opened a "Basic" level account[^no-kyc].

> When you create an account on Bitfinex by linking your email address, your account becomes verified on the Basic level.

With just an email address `ShrekIsLove` was able:

> * to deposit and withdraw most listed currencies on Bitfinex;
> * to make exchange trading;
> * to have access to the Bitfinex OTC market.

In other words, it was enough for him to send his Bitcoin to the exchange and start his new life as a crypto day trader. Paying taxes on those trades was most certainly *not* part of that new life.

Unfortunately for our friend, his basic account level and US citizenship prevented him from taking advantage of all the options previously discussed.

> A U.S. person may only transfer the token to another iFinex customer, but may not purchase tokens. A customer who is not a U.S. person may purchase and transfer tokens without restriction if, in connection with each trade, the customer verifies to the Bitfinex Groupâ€™s satisfaction that the customer is not a U.S. person[^bfx-token-terms].

So he could hold or sell his BFX tokens but not buy. What about converting to equity?

BnkToTheFuture does have a verification process and allows US citizens to participate on their platform [^bttf-kyc]. For the sake of the article let's assume that `ShrekIsLove` met those qualifications.

Always susceptible to FOMO, `ShrekIsLove` decides to go legit. He proves to Bitfinex and BnkToTheFuture that he is a "sophisticated" and "accredited" investor of "high-net worth". They in turn give him equity and RRTs.

As the months went by more users converted and fewer BFX remained. The price of Bitcoin began to rally and trade volume picked up on the exchange. This led to iFinex buying up all the remaining BFX for the full $1.00 amount.

> A combination of factors has led to this seminal moment for Bitfinex, including a dramatic uptick in equity conversions; record operating results in March; and, the decision to reduce our reserves in favor of this opportunity. We are tremendously grateful to all of our customers and new shareholders for helping us get to this point. By the end of this week, we will be sending notes directly to our shareholders with more information about what to expect in the coming months.

The users who held their BFX tokens had their discrete losses recouped and those who bought more BFX tokens could have recouped their continuous losses and even made significant profit--ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ. For users like `ShrekIsLove` who converted to equity it's hard to say how they may have interpreted the news. I do not have access to the price charts for iFinex shares but I imagine they were doing well.

About one year after the hack on Auguest 11th 2017, iFinex announced that they were ending the verification process for US citizens.

> Bitfinex is making changes to the services we provide to U.S. individuals. These changes impact the verification process and trading of certain digital tokens for U.S. customers. Some changes are effective immediately, and others will be gradually implemented in the coming weeks[^no-more-us].

Two months later they announced they were kicking US citizens off the platform.

> ... we are terminating trading, deposits, and withdrawal functionality for U.S. individual customers by no later than November 9, 2017[^bye-bye-us].

What does this mean for `ShrekIsLove`? Besides moving his funds off the platform and trading elsewhere, he was forced to sell his RRT for cents on the dollar.

> U.S. individuals holding Recovery Right Tokens (RRTs), if any, which relate to the exchange of now-defunct BFX tokens to equity in iFinex Inc., may, starting on October 27, 2017, sell all of their RRTs on the exchange, if they so elect. This is an exception to the general terms of use for RRTs. U.S. individuals are not permitted to buy RRTs during this time period[^bye-bye-us].

Again, I do not know how a user like `ShrekIsLove` would have felt about this because it depends on the performance of the equity. If it far outpaced what he would have earned on that 1BTC he lost, then being forced to sell RRTs early wouldn't hurt that much. If the equity was performing poorly then this would feel like a punch in the gut. The other issue with the equity is how liquid is the market? And how "safe" is BnkToTheFuture?

> BNK To The FUTURE (HK) Limited (Company Number 2205217) is Incorporated and registered in Hong Kong under the Companies Bill 2011. This website (Trading name BnkToTheFuture.com) is operated by BNK TO THE FUTURE (Company Number CO-296093) Incorporated and registered in Cayman Islands under the Companies Law 2013. BNK TO THE FUTURE is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA License No. 1189274). 
> ...
> We take your trust very seriously[^bttf-regulated].

I'll leave it up to the reader to make their own opinion.

At this point in the story all of the US citizens are out of the token game. BFX tokens were bought up and no longer exist. And all US citizens were forced to sell their RRTs or no longer have access to them.

So what can `ShrekIsLove` do now?

iFinex is also the owner of Tether. Tether is a stablecoin pegged to $1.00. Tether is supposed to be redeemable for $1.00 

I find it a bit odd since not only did they issue a bunch of unregulated securities to wash their hands of the hack they also print tether like J-Pow is working there.

It's going to be some time before we can say "It's all ogre now".

While I won't go so far as to say iFinex operated with malicious intent I cannot imagine that their actions are "all good" in the eyes of the Department of Justice. Those who have speculated on RRTs and LEOs should be careful. I'm not confident enough to take either side of the bet all I know is it's going to be some time before we can say "It's all ogre now".

Just like BFX tokens these RRTs were also tradeable[^RRT-tradeable].

> For Bitfinex, BFX and this clause, if it holds up in Court, would permit them to generate a debt instrument out of pure imagination, give it a totally arbitrary valuation, dump it on victims, let the market value it as a contingent notional asset (i.e. unlikely to realize value) and then, when the holders try to get any value of it by trading, they lose both the difference between the arbitrary valuation and the actual realizable value (which really represents the loss they take from the hack), AND THEY LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO SUE. For Bitfinex, this permits them to buy back the debt at a fraction of cost and get full releases against the issued value.

In an ideal world, these coins would be returned directly to those who held them prior to the August 2016 hack. Unfortunately it will be very difficult for the DOJ to setup a system to do this accurately. I still believe this is the right thing to do. Giving the coins to Bitfinex will not make the original holders whole it.

Earlier this week the US govt recovered.... Allegedly this girl boss stole it with her husband.

Headlines didn't say it but after reading the DOJ press release I noticed this was Bitfinex's stolen Bitcoin!

And of course UNUS SED LEO got a massive pump. WTF is UNUS SED LEO you're asking? To answer that we'll have to go back to August 2nd 2016.

## Security Breach

> Today we discovered a security breach that requires us to halt all trading on Bitfinex, as well as halt all digital token deposits to and withdrawals from Bitfinex.

Imagine being an "early" adopter in an unproven cryptocurrency with a significant amount of your sitting on the chain.

> The theft is being reported to â€” and we are co-operating with â€” law enforcement.

Probably the first and last time they "co-operated".

## A Very Expensive Haircut

> After much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context. Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%. In a later announcement we will explain in full detail the methodology used to compute these losses.

Instead of figuring out the problem they put it on their users. Every user would lose 36.067% of all their holdings. In short, they got Bitfinex'ed.

But as we all know, a new token can solve any problem! Bitfinex created the BFX token and distributed them to their wounded userbase. Say Chloe had 3BTC at the time of the hack. They now have roughly 2BTC. That is a loss of roughly $600 at the time (man I should have bought Bitcoin in 2016). So Bitfinex awarded them with 600 BFX tokens.
 
So now, most users have either traded away their tokens for pennies on the dollar, converted to equity, or in very rare cases been redeemed by Bitfinex. The company is able to pat themselves on the back and say they've fulfilled their moral obligations to their users and that there are no more BFX tokens.

To incentivise users to convert to equity they created another token called RRT.

## RRT

They said they would redeem those tokens for real dollars when they were able to. Our friend Chloe held their 2BTC and 600RRT for all these years, Bitfinex receives the unstollen coins from the government and they exchange Chloe's 600BFX for 600USD. Well that's stil a "loss" of about $34,000 because Bitcoin isn't worth $600 now it's worth $40,000. But BFX tokens do not exist. Shortly after these tokens were distributed, Bitfinex strongly encouraged the token holders to convert to iFinex equity. 1BFX for 1 share of private equity. Why this price? Because Bitfinex said so.

For Bitfinex, this is a fantastic position to be in. Not only did they put the vast majority of their loss on the users, they no longer have any obligation to pay their users back in the event that the funds are returned.

# UNUS SED LEO

> Our â€˜Unus sed leoâ€™ ethos means we stand and move boldly and bravely, doing everything in our power to do right by our customers and the community at large in the face of adversity.

Because greed in this space is insatiable. They decided to raise funds by offering a token sale. USL is the fuel of a sort of scammy rewards programs. Holders of this coin can get discounts and stuff. Usually when real companies want to raise money they have to sell equity or debt but when you're operating in the cryptosphere (metaverse?) you can just conjure tokens out of thin air that come with no legal obligation or regulatory scrutiny whatsoever. All upside, no downside.

> Bitfinex took a unique approach, allocating the losses across all accounts and crediting specially-designed BFX tokens to customers at a ratio of 1 BFX to 1 dollar lost. Bitfinex honoured its commitment to repay the losses. Within eight months of the security breach, all BFX token holders had their tokens redeemed at 100 cents on the dollar, or had exchanged their tokens, directly or indirectly, for shares of the capital stock of iFinex Inc. All BFX tokens were redeemed and destroyed through this process. 
https://www.bitfinex.com/legal/token-terms/rrt

> As of November 30, 2016, the total number of RRTs issued and outstanding is equal to 30,199,822.40.

It's like that meme where the guy wakes up from a coma and asks how much is Bitcoin worth. This hack and subsequent recovery may have been the best timeline for Bitfinex. Take 30% of your users Bitcoin. Send them into the ether for 6 years so you can't sell them. Only pay back your users the dollar amount they lost. Profit immensely.

Ironic that the government now has to decide whether to give a company that's counterfited 10s of billions of dollars billions of dollars.
