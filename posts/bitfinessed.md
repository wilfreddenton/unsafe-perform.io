# Who Are the Real Criminals?

For those who have the ability to ignore cyptocurrency news, the United States Department of Justice published a press release from February 8th 2022: *Two Arrested for Alleged Conspiracy to Launder $4.5 Billion in Stolen Cryptocurrency*[^DOJ-press-release].

> According to court documents, Lichtenstein and Morgan allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin that were stolen from Bitfinexâ€™s platform after a hacker breached Bitfinexâ€™s systems and initiated more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions.

Notice the language used here: "stolen from Bitfinex's platform" not "stolen from Bitfinex". The coins belonged to the users of the platform and not the platform itself. Unfortunately for them, the old "not your keys, not your coins" adage rung true.

The hack was reported by Bitfinex on August 2nd 2016.

> Today we discovered a security breach that requires us to halt all trading on Bitfinex, as well as halt all digital token deposits to and withdrawals from Bitfinex[^security-breach].

If this was heart-wrenching for Bitfinex users to read, the update published four days later would give them a full-on heart attack.

> After much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context. Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%[^security-breach-update].

Unable or unwilling to eat the losses themselves, Bitfinex passed it on by taking 36% of customer funds: BTC, ETH, USD, etc.

> In place of the loss in each wallet, we are crediting a token labeled BFX to record each customerâ€™s discrete losses. Tokens will be distributed without release or waiver. The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until redeemed in full by Bitfinex or possibly exchangedâ€”upon the creditorâ€™s request and Bitfinexâ€™s acceptanceâ€”for shares of iFinex Inc[^security-breach].

Think of BFX tokens as IOUs. They were unregulated, came with no defined payback schedule, offered zero interest, and were provided to users in a forced sale.

The number of BFX a user received was based on their "discrete losses" as opposed to "continuous losses". Suppose a user `ShrekIsLove` had 3BTC on Bitfinex pre-hack. The hack occurs and Bitfinex takes 36% of their BTC, about 1BTC, in exchange for around 600BFX tokens. $600 was roughly the USD price of Bitcoin at the time of the hack. Of course the numbers used were significantly more precise but round numbers are easier to think about. Bitfinex significantly reduced their debt by "snapshotting" the price because Bitcoin rallied until December 2017 when it reached an all time high of $20,000. It seems `1BTC == 1BTC` until shit hits the fan. 

Obviously, this methodology upset a lot of users but some saw it as the best chance for recouping their losses and were understanding[^understanding]. So what are `ShrekIsLove`s options going forward?

1. Hold their BFX tokens in the hopes that Bitfinex would redeem them for the full amount,
2. sell them for cents on the dollar to other traders,
3. or convert them to iFinex shares, Bitfinex's parent company. 

**I'll be referring to iFinex in place of Bitfinex for the rest of the article**.

iFinex was redeeming BFX tokens albeit slowly [^redemption-slow]. As a result, confidence that redemption of all the coins was low and their open market price of around $0.30 reflected that[^30-cents]. Sellers wanted to recoup a portion of their losses and be done with the ordeal waiving all legal claims against iFinex on account of the losses[^bfx-token-terms]. Buyers and holders were betting that iFinex would repurchase their tokens for the full dollar amount. iFinex partnered with a company called BnkToTheFuture to create a Special Purpose Vehicle [SPV], which surprisingly is not a Delorean that time travels to before the hack, but a way for users to convert BFX tokens into equity[^spv]. iFinex wanted their users to convert as this would reduce the number of BFX tokens they were obligated to redeem regardless of the recovery of stolen funds. To push users in this direction they introduced the second of three tokens called the Recovery Right Token [RRT]. 

RRTs are nearly identical to BFXs in that they represent a $1.00 debt owed to the holder and are tradeable on the exchange. The difference is that iFinex is only obligated to redeem RRTs when and if the stolen coins were recovered. A user who chose to convert would lose the chance of being redeemed prior to recovery but maintain the right to redemption if a recovery occured and gain a stake in a highly profitable business assuming iFinex could make it through these choppy waters. If a user wanted to go this route, they would need to act fast:

> If subscribed on or before October 7, 2016, each investor will get 1 RRT for each BFX token exchanged for shares;
> If subscribed after October 7, 2016, and on or before October 31, 2016, each investor will get Â½ an RRT for each BFX token exchanged for shares;
> If subscribed after October 31, 2016, and on or before November 30, 2016, each investor will get Â¼ an RRT for each BFX token exchanged for shares; and,
> If subscribed after November 30, 2016, no RRTs will be delivered[^rtt].

This FOMO based scheme incentivised users to convert to shares quickly. The longer users held their BFX in the hopes of redemption, the fewer RRTs they'd receive if they ended up converting.

`ShrekIsLove` is a US citizen but he did not share that information with Bitfinex. He didn't have to as he only opened a "Basic" level account[^no-kyc].

> When you create an account on Bitfinex by linking your email address, your account becomes verified on the Basic level.

With just an email address `ShrekIsLove` was able:

> * to deposit and withdraw most listed currencies on Bitfinex;
> * to make exchange trading;
> * to have access to the Bitfinex OTC market.

In other words, it was enough for him to send his Bitcoin to the exchange and start his new life as a crypto day trader. However, his basic account level and US citizenship prevented him from taking advantage of all the options previously discussed.

> A U.S. person may only transfer the token to another iFinex customer, but may not purchase tokens. A customer who is not a U.S. person may purchase and transfer tokens without restriction if, in connection with each trade, the customer verifies to the Bitfinex Groupâ€™s satisfaction that the customer is not a U.S. person[^bfx-token-terms].

So he could hold or sell his BFX tokens but not buy. What about converting to equity?

BnkToTheFuture does have a verification process and allows US citizens to participate on their platform [^bttf-kyc]. For the sake of the article let's assume that `ShrekIsLove` met those qualifications.

Always susceptible to FOMO, `ShrekIsLove` decides to go legit. He proves to Bitfinex and BnkToTheFuture that he is a "sophisticated" and "accredited" investor of "high-net worth". They in turn give him equity and RRTs.

As the months went by more users converted and supply of BFX decreased. The price of Bitcoin began to rally and trade volume picked up on the exchange. This led to iFinex buying up all the remaining BFX for the full $1.00 amount.

> A combination of factors has led to this seminal moment for Bitfinex, including a dramatic uptick in equity conversions; record operating results in March; and, the decision to reduce our reserves in favor of this opportunity. We are tremendously grateful to all of our customers and new shareholders for helping us get to this point. By the end of this week, we will be sending notes directly to our shareholders with more information about what to expect in the coming months.

The users who held their BFX tokens had their discrete losses recouped and those who bought more BFX tokens could have recouped their continuous losses and even made significant profit--ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ. For users like `ShrekIsLove` who converted to equity it's hard to say how they may have interpreted the news. I do not have access to the price charts for iFinex shares but I imagine they were doing well.

About one year after the hack on Auguest 11th 2017, iFinex announced that they were ending the verification process for US citizens.

> Bitfinex is making changes to the services we provide to U.S. individuals. These changes impact the verification process and trading of certain digital tokens for U.S. customers. Some changes are effective immediately, and others will be gradually implemented in the coming weeks[^no-more-us].

Two months later they announced they were kicking US citizens off the platform.

> ... we are terminating trading, deposits, and withdrawal functionality for U.S. individual customers by no later than November 9, 2017[^bye-bye-us].

`ShrekIsLove` had to move his funds off the platform and trade elsewhere. Because Bitfinex is the only market for RRTs[^only-market] he was forced to sell his for cents on the dollar long before the recovery of stolen funds.

> U.S. individuals holding Recovery Right Tokens (RRTs), if any, which relate to the exchange of now-defunct BFX tokens to equity in iFinex Inc., may, starting on October 27, 2017, sell all of their RRTs on the exchange, if they so elect. This is an exception to the general terms of use for RRTs. U.S. individuals are not permitted to buy RRTs during this time period[^bye-bye-us].

Again, I do not know how a user like `ShrekIsLove` would have felt about this because it depends on the performance of the equity. If it far outpaced what he would have earned on that 1BTC he lost, then being forced to sell RRTs early wouldn't hurt that much. If the equity was performing poorly then this would feel like a punch in the gut. The other issue with the equity is how liquid is the market? And how "safe" is BnkToTheFuture?

> BNK To The FUTURE (HK) Limited (Company Number 2205217) is Incorporated and registered in Hong Kong under the Companies Bill 2011. This website (Trading name BnkToTheFuture.com) is operated by BNK TO THE FUTURE (Company Number CO-296093) Incorporated and registered in Cayman Islands under the Companies Law 2013. BNK TO THE FUTURE is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA License No. 1189274). 
> ...
> We take your trust very seriously[^bttf-regulated].

I'll leave it up to the reader to make their own opinion.

At this point in the story, all of the US citizens are out of the token game. BFX tokens were bought up and no longer exist. And all US citizens were forced to sell their RRTs or no longer have access to them.

Well, not quite all tokens. If you've ever ventured into the cryptosphere you've probably heard of iFinex's most notorious token--Tether. Tether is a stablecoin that is pegged to the dollar. This means that the price of Tether should always be $1.00.

Tether is used because it's convenient. Many many people hold tether especially during downturns in the market. If the space lost confidence it could be disaterous.

In 2019 one of iFinex's "banks" had their assets seized. Including 850 million of Bitfinex's cash. To keep the exchange afloat they borrowed from the tether reserves.

NYAg steps in. Tether says but we changed the terms of service.

To learn more about Tether I highly recommend reading this Bloomberg [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether)

Runs token sale of LEO to recapitalize.

LEOs are like BFXs on steroids.

> On a monthly basis, iFinex and its affiliates will buy back LEO from the market equal to a minimum of 27% of the consolidated gross revenues of iFinex (exclusive of Ethfinex) from the previous month, until no tokens are in commercial circulation. Repurchases will be made at then-prevailing market rates. LEO tokens used to pay fees may also be used to satisfy this repurchase commitment[^leo-whitepaper].

Like more legitimate debt instruments, a schedule for paying down the debt is provide. Unfortunately there is no way for holders to verify that "a minimum of 27% of" revenue was actually being used to buy back the tokens but they could verify that some were bought back every month.

The constant reduction in supply of the tokens and the demand for them based on their utility would ideally for holders act as a sort of interest rate increasing the price of the coin over time.

> In addition to the above, an amount equal to at least 95% of recovered net funds from Crypto Capital (described more fully herein) will be used to repurchase and burn outstanding LEO tokens within 18 months from the date of recovery[^leo-whitepaper].
> Further, an amount equal to at least 80% of recovered net funds from the BitFinex hack will be used to repurchase and burn outstanding LEO tokens within 18 months from the date of recovery[^leo-whitepaper].

These are similar to a stock buyback and in theory should boost the price of the coin significantly and provide profit to users who helped recapitalize iFinex in the initial sale.

![rrt price](assets/leo-price.png)

Notice how in both these graphs the price gets a significant boost in January a month before the DOJ announcement. Smells like insider trading to me.

So people are really betting that iFinex will receive the coins from the DOJ. I believe this outcome to be unlikely.

> Today, federal law enforcement demonstrates once again that we can follow money through the blockchain, and that we will not allow cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system...[^DOJ-press-release]

If this is true then the DOJ has a massive bone to pick with iFinex. Their lax KYC/AML rules on their exchange most certainly lead to tax evasion and money laundering. Their Tether stablecoin has been proven to be used for money laundering. Every time iFinex is hit by a crisis they solve it buy selling unregulated debt instruments and they print Tether like J-Pow is working there. Focusing on the two miscreants who somehow ended up with 120,000 Bitcoins is a mistake. Go after the real threat to the economy.

While I won't go so far as to say iFinex operated with malicious intent I cannot imagine that their actions are "all good" in the eyes of the Department of Justice. Those who have speculated on RRTs and LEOs should be careful. I'm not confident enough to take either side of the bet all I know is it's going to be some time before we can say "It's all ogre now".

> As of November 30, 2016, the total number of RRTs issued and outstanding is equal to 30,199,822.40.
