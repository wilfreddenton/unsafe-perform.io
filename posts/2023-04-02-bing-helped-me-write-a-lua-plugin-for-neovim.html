<h1>Bing Helped Me Write a Lua Plugin for Neovim</h1>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write me a neovim lua script that keeps a history of buffers for each window
and has a command for going backwards and forwards in history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local history = {}
local current = 0

function AddToHistory()
  local bufnr = vim.fn.bufnr()
  local winid = vim.fn.win_getid()
  local entry = {bufnr, winid}
  table.insert(history, entry)
  current = #history
end

function GoBack()
  if current &gt; 1 then
    current = current - 1
    local entry = history[current]
    vim.fn.bufload(entry[1])
    vim.fn.win_gotoid(entry[2])
  end
end

function GoForward()
  if current &lt; #history then
    current = current + 1
    local entry = history[current]
    vim.fn.bufload(entry[1])
    vim.fn.win_gotoid(entry[2])
  end
end

vim.cmd([[autocmd BufEnter * lua AddToHistory()]])
vim.cmd([[command! -nargs=0 Back lua GoBack()]])
vim.cmd([[command! -nargs=0 Forward lua GoForward()]])
</code></pre>
<p>In less than 5 seconds Bing spits out the above. A quick read of it puts me in
a state of mild shock. For someone who has never written Lua and is totally
unfamiliar with the Neovim related APIs, this output is incredibly useful.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p><strong>The generated code contains examples of basic Lua syntax</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function Name() -- function definitions
end

if P then -- if statements
end

local name = {} -- variable definitions

#history -- length of table

table.insert(index, value) -- append to table
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what <code>[[]]</code> in the <code>vim.cmd()</code> means so I ask Bing:</p>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what is double bracket syntax in lua</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Lua, double square brackets are used to enclose literal strings which
traverse several lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's further info and links to Lua docs and stack overflow as well.</p>
<p><strong>It familiarizes me with some of the Neovim specific APIs that are necessary
for the plugin</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">vim.fn.bufnr() -- get the number (ID) of the current buffer

vim.fn.win_getid() -- get the ID of the current window

vim.fn.bufload(bufnr) -- load a buffer by its number into the current window

vim.fn.win_gotoid(winid) -- move to window by its ID

vim.cmd() -- run vim script
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I later changed these to the <code>vim.api.nvim_*</code> equivalents. When asked, Bing served them up without a hitch.</p>
<p><strong>It provides me with a basic structure for the plugin</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">- track the history in a table

- track the current place in history

- function for adding new buffers into history

- function for going backwards in history

- function for going forwards in history

- use autocommand to track `BufEnter` events and handle them with the add function
</code></pre>
<p>So does it work? <strong>No</strong>, and I'm thankful for that. I will remain employed for
the foreseeable future 😅.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p><strong>The <code>vim.cmd</code> block at the bottom of the script is essentially vim script and
not Lua</strong>.</p>
<p>I asked Bing if it was possible to do this in pure Lua:</p>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how to create an autocommand for neovim in lua</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... You can also use <code>vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd()</code> to create autocommands</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer includes a link to the Neovim Lua docs where I can learn more about
this function.</p>
<p><strong>The script maintains a global history across all windows instead of a
separate history for each window</strong>.</p>
<p>I prompt Bing a couple times to try and fix this issue but never get any output
better than the original. I think this "nesting" is a bit beyond the AI's
current capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>The script does not delete entries past the current index when opening a new
file</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">history:
  1. file_b
  2. file_a &lt;- current
  3. file_d

action:
  open file_r

expected:
  1. file_b
  2. file_a
  3. file_r &lt;- current

actual:
  1. file_b
  2. file_a
  3. file_d
  4. fild_r &lt;- current
</code></pre>
<p>To be fair, I didn't tell Bing that I wanted this behavior and honestly, I'm
not really sure how to put it into simple enough terms for a prompt anyways.
I'll just implement it manually.</p>
<p><strong>Even if the buffer being added is the same as the current buffer, the script
adds a new entry in history</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">history:
  1. file_b
  2. file_a &lt;- current
  3. file_d

action:
  open file_a

expected:
  1. file_b
  2. file_a &lt;- current
  3. file_d

actual:
  1. file_b
  2. file_a
  3. file_d
  4. file_a &lt;- current
</code></pre>
<p>While there's plenty of work to be done, I'm significantly more confident in my
ability to complete the plugin because I have a great assistant--Bing.</p>
<h2>My First Neovim Plugin!</h2>
<p>A few more hours of coding across a couple days and about 30 Bing prompts
later, I have the plugin in a satisfactory state.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wilfreddenton/history.nvim/">history.nvim</a></p>
<p>Take a look at the code. You'll see that a lot of the generated script's DNA
remains. The largest addition is another command to display the history in a
popup.</p>
<p>Manually scanning through the Neovim Lua docs is slow. It's better to first ask
Bing questions like "Using lua how can I set the position of the cursor in
neovim?" and "Using lua how can I close a window in neovim?" At worst the
chatbot provides something to search for in the docs and at best gives a
complete answer with an explanation and sources.</p>
<p>While there are, of course, many issues with the way large language models have
been unleashed onto the world, so far, I am grateful for them. Bing chat is an
excellent tool for exploring domains outside my immediate area of expertise. It
does not invalidate my years of experience; it enhances it. Without that
experience, I would never have been able to take what Bing generated and turn
it into what I envisioned. I wouldn't know what was good or bad about it. It
does however, greatly increase the velocity at which I am able to develop.</p>
<p>Thanks Bing 💙.</p>
